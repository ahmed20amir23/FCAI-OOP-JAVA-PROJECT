# FCAI-OOP-JAVA-PROJECT
🛠️ Description
This project is a demonstration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in action. It showcases how to apply OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to build clean, modular, and maintainable code.

📌 Features
Encapsulation: Ensures data security and restricts direct access to class members.
Inheritance: Reuses and extends functionality from parent classes.
Polymorphism: Implements flexible and reusable code through method overriding and overloading.
Abstraction: Provides a clear and simplified interface for complex logic.
Designed using SOLID principles to enhance code readability and maintainability.
